## Abstract
Inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) projects are increasingly utilized as "technological fixes" to address regional water scarcity, yet they often trigger complex socio-hydrological feedbacks. One such phenomenon is the "rebound effect," where increased water security encourages agricultural intensification, potentially offsetting the hydrological gains intended for regional recovery. This review examines the global and local context of IBWT, with a specific focus on the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP) in Sri Lanka. By synthesizing literature on socio-hydrology, remote sensing methodologies, and agricultural intensification, this paper identifies critical research gaps in quantifying the behavioral responses of agricultural systems to artificial supply increases. A conceptual framework is proposed to integrate multi-sensor satellite data (GRACE, Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS) into an assessment of the socio-hydrological rebound effect in the Kirindi Oya recipient basin.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview of Inter-Basin Water Transfers (IBWT) Globally
Inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) involves the physical conveyance of water from a "donor" basin with perceived surplus to a "recipient" basin facing water scarcity (Snaddon & Davies, 2006). Globally, IBWT has become a cornerstone of water management, with major projects like China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWTP) and India's Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) project reshaping continental hydrologies (Rollason et al., 2021). These projects are typically driven by the need to support rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and agricultural expansion in arid regions.

### 1.2 Motivations and Controversies of IBWT Projects
The primary motivation for IBWT is the correction of spatial mismatches between water availability and socio-economic demand. Proponents argue that IBWT ensures food security and stabilizes regional economies (Katz, 2016). However, these projects are frequently mired in controversy. Environmental critics highlight the alteration of natural flow regimes, loss of biodiversity, and the "silent" ecological costs in donor basins (Zhuang et al., 2025). Socially, IBWT can lead to the displacement of communities and the violation of downstream water rights, as seen in the early rejection of the Uma Oya project by international funders (Rathnayake & Suratissa, 2016).

### 1.3 Key Socio-Hydrological Concepts including the Rebound Effect
Socio-hydrology focuses on the co-evolution of human and water systems, emphasizing the feedback loops that emerge from their interaction (Sivapalan et al., 2012). A critical challenge in IBWT is the "rebound effect," a concept derived from the Jevons Paradox in energy economics. In a water context, the rebound effect occurs when improvements in water supply or efficiency lead to an expansion of water-intensive activities, resulting in a paradoxical increase in total consumption (Dong et al., 2023). This behavioral response can diminish the project's capacity to restore groundwater levels or maintain ecological flows.

### 1.4 Relevance of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Satellite Data
Assessing the impacts of mega-scale IBWT requires spatiotemporal depth that traditional ground-based monitoring cannot provide. Remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer tools to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) changes, vegetation health, and terrestrial water storage (TWS) trends at a basin scale (Cui et al., 2025). The integration of multi-sensor data allows for a holistic quantification of the water balance, which is essential for detecting the subtle signals of agricultural intensification.

## 2. Context of Sri Lanka

### 2.1 Historical and Policy Background of IBWT in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka has a long history of trans-basin water management, dating back to ancient hydraulic civilizations. In the modern era, the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project (AMDP) stands as the largest multi-purpose intervention, diverting Mahaweli water to the dry North Central and Eastern provinces (De Silva & Hornberger, 2019). Policy in Sri Lanka has traditionally prioritized "supply-side" management to achieve rice self-sufficiency, often overlooking the socio-hydrological feedbacks in recipient basins.

### 2.2 Description of the Uma Oya Project and its Objectives
The Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP) is a major trans-basin initiative designed to divert approximately 145–150 million cubic meters (MCM) of water annually from the Uma Oya (a tributary of the Mahaweli River) to the Kirindi Oya basin (ADB, 2014; Rathnayake & Suratissa, 2016). The project’s core objectives include:
- Generation of 120 MW of hydroelectric power.
- Provision of irrigation water for approximately 4,500–6,000 hectares of new and existing agricultural lands.
- Provision of drinking and industrial water for the Hambantota and Monaragala districts.

### 2.3 Hydrological and Agricultural Characteristics of the Kirindi Oya Basin
The Kirindi Oya basin is located in the southeastern dry zone of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by high seasonal variability in rainfall and chronic water shortages, particularly during the Yala (dry) season. The basin supports significant paddy cultivation, centered around the Lunugamvehera reservoir. However, water scarcity has historically limited cropping intensity and expansion, making the basin a prime candidate for IBWT-driven intensification.

## 3. Socio-Hydrology and the Rebound Effect

### 3.1 Definitions and Theoretical Background of Socio-Hydrological Feedbacks
Socio-hydrological feedbacks describe how human interventions (like building a dam) change the hydrological cycle, which then influences human behavior (like expanding farms), creating a continuous loop (Sivapalan et al., 2012). In IBWT systems, the "supply-stress-offset" loop is prevalent: the influx of water reduces stress, leading to a "rebound" in demand that offsets the initial gains (Dong et al., 2023).

### 3.2 The Rebound Effect in Water Systems: Analogies from Economics
The "Efficiency Paradox" or Jevons Paradox suggests that as a resource becomes cheaper or more available, its consumption increases rather than decreases. In irrigation, technological improvements (e.g., drip irrigation) often lead farmers to plant more water-intensive crops or expand their irrigated area, resulting in "dry" savings at the field scale but "wet" losses at the basin scale (Seckler, 1996; Karimi et al., 2012).

### 3.3 Evidence of Rebound Effects in Irrigation and Water Resource Development
Global studies provide robust evidence of the rebound effect. In the North China Plain, IBWT stabilized the regional water storage deficit, but its positive impact was significantly offset by increased crop water consumption due to higher grain yields and intensification (Dong et al., 2023). Similarly, in the Indus Basin, high basin-level efficiency did not translate to water savings because "saved" water was reallocated to maximize harvest indices (Karimi et al., 2012).

## 4. Remote Sensing & GIS in Water Transfer Studies

### 4.1 Satellite Datasets used in IBWT Research
A multi-sensor approach is necessary for comprehensive assessment:
- **GRACE/GRACE-FO:** Monitors regional Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) anomalies and groundwater recovery (Tapley et al., 2019).
- **Landsat & Sentinel-2:** Provides high-resolution mapping of LULC, crop types, and vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI).
- **MODIS:** Useful for long-term, high-frequency monitoring of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Evapotranspiration (ET).
- **GPM/CHIRPS:** Provides satellite-derived precipitation data to disentangle climate-driven vs. human-driven changes.

### 4.2 Methods for Assessing Impact
- **LULC Change:** Using Random Forest or SVM classifiers in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to track agricultural expansion (Chipman et al., 2016).
- **Vegetation Intensity:** Analyzing NDVI/EVI trends and phenological shifts (e.g., earlier SOS, delayed EOS) to detect intensification (Cui et al., 2025).
- **Evapotranspiration (ET):** Applying energy balance models like SEBAL, METRIC, or ETLook to quantify actual crop water consumption (Bastiaanssen et al., 2012).
- **Groundwater/Subsidence:** Integrating GRACE with Sentinel-1 InSAR to monitor localized recharge and land subsidence (Cui et al., 2025).

### 4.3 Limitations in Sri Lankan Conditions
Cloud cover during the monsoon seasons significantly limits the availability of optical imagery (Landsat/Sentinel-2). Furthermore, the small and fragmented nature of Sri Lankan farm plots requires high-resolution data (10m or higher) to accurately capture changes in cropping patterns, making 250m-resolution MODIS data insufficient for field-level analysis.

## 5. Agricultural Intensification after IBWT

### 5.1 Evidence from Global and Regional Case Studies
Research in the Yellow River Basin shows that IBWT promotes water use efficiency only when accompanied by stringent pricing and quotas; otherwise, "cheap" water leads to wasteful intensification (Ma & Wang, 2024). In the Tarim Basin, agricultural land nearly tripled in extent following improved water management, driven by the conversion of desert to irrigated farmland (Chipman et al., 2016).

### 5.2 Remote Sensing Indicators of Intensification
Key indicators include:
- Increased number of cropping cycles (e.g., shift from single-crop to double-crop paddy).
- Increase in peak NDVI and Leaf Area Index (LAI) within a single season.
- Expansion of irrigated perimeters into formerly rainfed or fallow lands.

### 5.3 Relationship Between Water Availability and Cropping Patterns
The perception of "guaranteed" water from IBWT reduces the risk-perception of farmers, encouraging the cultivation of high-value, water-intensive crops (e.g., shifting from subsidiary crops to year-round paddy) (Dong et al., 2023).

## 6. IBWT in Sri Lanka — Uma Oya & Kirindi Oya Basin

### 6.1 Review of Existing Research on Uma Oya IBWT
Current research on Uma Oya has focused primarily on the environmental disasters in the donor basin (Uva Province). Studies have documented significant groundwater depletion, drying of wells, and land subsidence in Bandarawela caused by the 25-kilometer tunneling process (Somananda, 2018; Rathnayake & Suratissa, 2016).

### 6.2 Hydrological and Socio-Economic Impacts
In the donor area, 80% of wells dried up and agricultural fields were destroyed, creating thousands of "development refugees" (Somananda, 2018). In the recipient basin (Kirindi Oya), the expected impacts include increased cropping intensity and hydropower generation. However, a critical analysis of how this new water supply alters the long-term water balance of the Kirindi Oya basin remains absent.

### 6.3 Previous Use of Satellite Data for Uma Oya
While global projects like the SNWTP have been extensively monitored via satellite, there is a significant lack of peer-reviewed satellite-based assessments for the Uma Oya project, particularly regarding the recipient basin's agricultural transformations.

## 7. Identified Research Gaps

1. **Lack of Integrated Socio-Hydrological Models for Sri Lanka:** Most studies are either purely hydrological or purely socio-economic, failing to capture the feedback loop between the two.
2. **Insufficient Satellite-Based Quantification of Rebound Effects:** There is no documented effort to use multi-sensor data (GRACE + Sentinel + MODIS) to quantify how much of the Uma Oya transfer is "lost" to agricultural intensification in the Kirindi Oya basin.
3. **Need for Long-term Multi-sensor Data Analysis:** Research has been reactive to disasters in the donor basin; proactive, long-term monitoring of the recipient basin’s intensification is missing.

## 8. Conceptual Framework for Proposed Study

### 8.1 Socio-Hydrological Model Linking IBWT and Rebound
The proposed study will be guided by a model where:
1. **Input:** IBWT volumes from Uma Oya increase surface water availability in Kirindi Oya.
2. **Human Response:** Farmers perceive increased security, leading to expanded irrigated area and higher cropping intensity (detected via Sentinel-2 and Landsat).
3. **Hydrological Feedback:** Increased biomass leads to higher actual Evapotranspiration (ET) (quantified via MODIS/Landsat energy balance).
4. **Net Impact:** The "Rebound Effect" is calculated as the ratio of increased ET to the total volume of IBWT.

### 8.2 Quantifying Components with Satellite Data
- **IBWT Volume:** Ground-gauged data correlated with satellite-derived reservoir levels (Sentinel-2/Landsat).
- **Irrigated Area & Intensity:** Multi-temporal NDVI and phenology analysis.
- **Water Storage Recovery:** GRACE/GRACE-FO for TWS trends.
- **Water Loss:** Energy balance-based ET estimation.

## 9. Conclusion
The Uma Oya Inter-Basin Water Transfer represents a significant engineering effort to solve water scarcity in southern Sri Lanka, but it risks triggering a socio-hydrological rebound effect. Literature suggests that without careful management, the influx of water may merely fuel agricultural intensification, leading to higher consumption and renewed scarcity. Current research gaps highlight a critical need for integrated, satellite-based assessments that quantify these human-water feedbacks. This proposed study will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the rebound effect in the Kirindi Oya basin, offering a vital framework for sustainable water management in Sri Lanka's future IBWT projects.
